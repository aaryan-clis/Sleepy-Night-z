    <h2> There are 3 tips to fall asleep when you want to :-</h2>
    <h3> 1. Power Down:- The soft blue glow from a cell phone, tablet, or digital clock on your bedside table may hurt your sleep.

        Tip: Turn off TVs, computers, and other blue-light sources an hour before you go to bed. Cover any displays you can't shut off.</h3>
    <h3>2. Nix Naps:- You’ll rest better at night. But if you have to snooze while the sun's up, keep it to 20 minutes or less. Nap in the early part of the day.

            Tip: Overcome an afternoon energy slump with a short walk, a glass of ice water, or a phone call with a friend.</h3>
    <h3>3. Look for Hidden Caffeine:-Coffee in the morning is fine for most people. But as soon as the clock strikes noon, avoid caffeine in foods and drinks.  Even small amounts found in chocolate can affect your ZZZs later that night.

        Tip: Read labels. Some pain relievers and weight loss pills contain caffeine </h3>
    <h3>11. Eat Right at Night:- Don’t eat heavy foods and big meals too late. They overload your digestive system, which affects how well you sleep. Have a light evening snack of cereal with milk or crackers and cheese instead.

        Tip: Finish eating at least an hour before bed.</h3>
